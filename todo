# PRELIMINARIES
- [ ] implement COO multiplication with vector
- [ ] implement CSR multiplication with vector

# DELIVERABLE
- [ ] implement conversion COO to CSR
- [ ] implement 



-------------------------------
DELIVERABLE1 INSTRUCTION
-------------------------------

1) Read Matrix in Matrix Format and convert to CSR
2) Multiply the Matrix with a randomly generated array
3) Design a parallel code on a shared-memory system (using ....)



1) write python script that generates a random sparse matrix into a .mtx file
2) convert the COO format from .mtx file into a CSR format matrix
3) figure out how to do MV product
4) experiment with different parallelization techniques, making sure it works corrctly

COO MATRIX:
you're given a matrix in COO format (with the 3 arrays);
you have:
# rows
# columns
# nz elements
you want:

row_indixes[i] , col_indexes[j], values[k] -> Matrix format
since C stores elements in a row major fashion:

row_index[i]*leading_dimension + col_index[j] = val[i][j]

/* 
*   Matrix Market I/O example program
*
*   Read a real (non-complex) sparse matrix from a Matrix Market (v. 2.0) file.
*   and copies it to stdout.  This porgram does nothing useful, but
*   illustrates common usage of the Matrix Matrix I/O routines.
*   (See http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket for details.)
*
*   Usage:  a.out [filename] > output
*
*       
*   NOTES:
*
*   1) Matrix Market files are always 1-based, i.e. the index of the first
*      element of a matrix is (1,1), not (0,0) as in C.  ADJUST THESE
*      OFFSETS ACCORDINGLY offsets accordingly when reading and writing 
*      to files.
*
*   2) ANSI C requires one to use the "l" format modifier when reading
*      double precision floating point numbers in scanf() and
*      its variants.  For example, use "%lf", "%lg", or "%le"
*      when reading doubles, otherwise errors will occur.
